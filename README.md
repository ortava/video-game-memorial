# Video Game Memorial
#### View the website: https://rabbitotm.github.io/video-game-memorial
This is a webpage in memoriam of the video games from my past that have been lost or sold. Becoming an adult has pulled my attention towards other responsibilities, so I have taken on the task to sell many of my childhood games as a symbol of moving forward. These games helped to shape me into who I am today, and this is my way of paying respects.

The video games and video game platforms featured on this website are only those that were previously in the possession of either me or my family.

This is my first website and my first personal programming project.
